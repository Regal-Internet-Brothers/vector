vector
======

A vector module for the [Monkey programming language](https://github.com/blitz-research/monkey).

This branch provides an experimental version of the main API. This version is meant to improve the underlying functionality of this module. Compatibility has *mostly* been broken, but a decent bit of existing code will work with little modification. **Use this version at your own risk.**
